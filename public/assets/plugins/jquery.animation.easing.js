Robert Penner's original easing equations modified for JQuery animate method

Below are easing equations based on Robert Penner's work, modified for JQuery
The "In" part of an animation is the start of it, the "Out" part is the end of it
If you apply "easing" at the "In" or the "Out" then the supplied animation curve is most apparent at that point
Enjoy the animation curves!

usage: $(".myImageID").animate({"left": "+=100"},{queue:false, duration:500, easing:"bounceEaseOut", complete:func});

Note in JQuey's native animate function the supplied parameters are supplied as follows:

easingAlgorythmEaseType: function( p, n, firstNum, diff )

@param p The time phase between 0 and 1
@param n Not sure what this is :), in any case its not used
@param firstNum The first number in the transform
@param diff The difference in in pixels required
